# PyTorch_CNN
 
 first load up and run torchMNIST.py to train the model once the model is trained the trained model will be save in trainedModel folder after that run the load_model.py to run the model against the testsets from the MNIST database and get the accuracy and loss vs EPOCHS chart
 
 To set up cuda so you can train the model using GPU which is wayyyyyyyy faster than doing it on cpu

Training on cuda on my gpu which is GTX 1650 took ~3:21 and on CPU on 3:21 mark it was still running epoch 3 (7 more to complete training BTW)
